# Space 1979 | When the Salmon Run
After a long draft Cinch Jones coughed,“It feels like we’ve been waiting for hours”

Basil watched the sky above the asteroid’s horizon,“Well, we’re kinda out of the way. Pass that thing back this way.”

Nigel cleaned off the soles of his boots on the van’s running boards,“What happened to Allan?”

“Here you go... “Cinch passed a hand rolled cigarette. “‘aven’t seen him since we crashed.”

“But wasn’t he driving?”

“Well, that sure explains the crash.”, Basil inhaled deeply, making the end of the cigarette glow in contrast with the starfield beyond.

“Yeah, thanks. What do we do with that guy in our van? Anybody know who he is?”, Nigel looked back to the van, Glovesy appeared at the window on que.

“Hey, sole brothas, what is all this noise in here? There sure is a lot. It looks like a life’s supply.”

Basil turned from his stargazing to the van,“That’s lunar. Anytime we pass by Earth we pick up some Jazz Cabbage. Here put this on, It’s good protection from the radiation out here. I’ll be fine, I still have my vest.”

Basil removed his outer blue velour coat and handed it to Glovesy.

“Thanks fillet-o-sole, ma’man.”

Basil looked to Nigel and Cinch with the fish equivalent of a raised eyebrow, the two shrugged in confusion.

Glovesy took the jacket. He unbuttoned the cuffs to fit his enormous hands through the slim tapered sleeves. The narrow shoulders had the fit of a child’s jacket salvaged from a lost and found bin.

“Look, I think our ride is here.”, Cinch Jones took a seat in the back of the van, on one of the bales of lunar, next to Glovesy.

A rusty old ship with an a-frame boom, hook, and chain parked in front of the wrecked van. It had an old style wedge shaped hood and round fenders. Despite the near absence of paint the doors had freshly hand-painted coach lining that read; Billiam Wrenschall & Sons Wrecking. From out of the driver’s side emerged a frail old man. He had thick round glasses and wore a felt trilby hat and dirty coveralls. With a length of old rusted chain slung across one shoulder he walked over to Basil Pete. He spoke nervously while he cleaned his glasses with an old paisley handkerchief.

“So, uh you, uh… boys? Need a tow back to Europa eh?”

“Yeah, I don’t think we are going to get very far since we hit this asteroid.”

“Well, if you got four rand then I think we can get started.”

“Four rand?! That’s near robbery!”

Old Billiam looked back to his truck,”Dana, Shannon. You boys come help your Papa with the chain and towbar.”

A pair of men exited the truck, there was a noticeable lightening from the landing gear’s suspension. Both men were well over six feet tall and together they stood at least as wide. It was suddenly a little less apparent exactly what type of wrecking service Billiam Wrenschall & Sons were engaged in.

Unmoved, Old Billiam continued to clean his glasses,“So, five rand is okay?”

“Wait, ah… Um, yeah that’s fine. I have it in the van.”

Basil opened the glovebox, Nigel anxiously looked around the van.

“Have you seen that cube thing?”

“I thought Cinch put it… Oh, no. In the glove… box.” Basil turned to Nigel with a worried look.

“We don’t have it, do we?”

“We can’t go back without it! We have to find it.”

Basil took the last of their money from the envelope in the glove box and rushed out of the van.

“Um...ah, Mr Wrenschall sir, ah we kinda need to go back to Luna first.”

With Dana and Shannon standing directly behind their father. Ol’ Billiam Wrenschall folded his handkerchief into the front pocket of his coveralls and put his glasses back on.

“Sure, but that’ll cost ya, that’ll cost ya a lot more.”

As the overhead doors closed over the Black Phoenix they shut out the light from Sol leaving only the docking port lights to show the way to the exits.

Ralph reached under his seat to retrieve a small pale green wooden box. Inside was a half face mask respirator tied to a brass leather trim box with a rubber hose.

“Here Psarah, you’ll need this until we get into the main greenhouse.”

“Thanks, are we on the Moon now?”

Melvin, in his natural state of annoyance, looked back.

“Don’t call it that. Unless you want to sound like an idiot. There are lots of Moons in space. This one is called Luna.”

Psarah’s excitement deflated as Ralph handed her the old military surplus breathing apparatus.

“Let’s go, we need to find what those fish-creeps have done with the Doctor’s cube.”

Ralph and Psarah followed Melvin to a door with a large sign next to it that read; Agricultural Complex 5, Wayne Gibbous Farm. Next to it was a brightly colored billboard with a picture of a happy farmer; an odd contrast to the stark concrete and steel of the docking port.

Ralph pushed the intercom button. A soft electric click followed by a chime and some static.

“Hello.”

“Is this Mr Gibbous? We’d—”

“Crackle, pop, crackle… No, this is his wife, Maxine Gibbous.”

“Is Mr Gibbous at home?”

There was a sound like someone dropping a telephone in the shower, then another chime and distorted shouting as Maxine neglected to remove her finger from the intercom button.

Melvin let out a long aggravated sigh and mumbled something indiscernible.

After several awkward minutes of not knowing what was going on the docking port airlock doors opened.

Melvin stepped into the airlock,“Let’s get this over with.”

Psarah held her ears as the pressure changed in the airlock.

The secondary doors opened. The dry docking port atmosphere met the greenhouse air. Condensation appeared on the metal doors and ran down in streams.

"Anyone fancy ah run, here eh.”

Wayne Gibbous stroked his long white beard and puffed on a long stemmed bone colored clay pipe.

Psarah looked past Wayne Gibbous and the evenly set rows of greenery. The bright sunlight gave the appearance of a warm Earthbound afternoon but through the greenhouse roof was the kind of night sky seen on a cold dry winter evening. For the first time in several days Psarah saw stars in a pattern that was familiar. Suddenly her vision blurred. Psarah moved her jaw to try to make her ears pop. She moved a hand toward the dull pain in her head.

“It’s really warm here- I feel odd. Mr Gibbous, sir? Is there a restroom here?”

Wayne pointed in a vague direction,“Ya feelin pekid, eh? Straight through that row-ah okra, turn right at the giant cahnivohous ficus, can’t miss it.”

Seeing Melvin’s frustration Ralph tried to put the conversation back on track.

“Mr Gibbous we’re hoping that you could help us with some information. We just have a few questions.”

The shirtless Wayne Gibbous mopped the sweat from his brow with a towel hung over his shoulders. He started to hop from foot to foot in an odd marching dance.

“Gotta keep mah heart rate up. We can talk as we go, here now, I’m right out straight. We’ll meet back with your friend by the way, on the other side ah the greenhouse.”

Wayne turned to a jog while smoking his pipe, leaving little clouds of smoke hung in the air like a stream engine.

Melvin pinched the bridge of his nose. Ralph followed Wayne with a walk only a few steps quicker than the pace he was accustomed to. The two were soon absorbed into the lush green backdrop. Melvin caught up with Wayne and Ralph in an arboretum at the end of the greenhouse. Ralph was sitting on a stone bench. Wayne Gibbous had one running shoe on a second bench. Still smoking his pipe, his elbow supported his weight on one knee. The blue white trimmed running shorts he was wearing displayed a disturbing amount of upper thigh. Ralph listened as Wayne entered full storytelling mode.

“That’s right, I was born on Europa. We moved here when I was just a boy. Even though mah fatheh was from down east Maine, he neveh could take the wicked gravity back on Eahth. But once ya go Lunar ya gotta keep up with yahself. Ya don’t want legs a rubbeh, eh? Evehy night afteh dinneh Pah an me ed run apiece.”

While Ralph seemed content to listen Melvin took a small notebook and pen from his inside jacket pocket. He looked to Wayne, folded the cover back and tapped a blank page with the back end of the pen.

“Mr Gibbous, we were wondering if you’ve seen anything odd. Maybe and old beat up van or some fish?”

“Fish? Ayuh, I know em. They come down here in that old beateh, on the regulah. Just can’t get enough ah the stuff.”

“So you’ve seen them?”

“Ayuh, my fishy friends come by quite often. See, tis the fish-nip. They can’t grow it themselves. They call it Lunah. I guess tis my Grandpa’s fault. Old fishehman’s trick, we called it the herb-bait. Back on Europa we’d spread er out on the wateh ta get em excited.”

Psarah held her hands to her flushed red face. The cool water from the sink felt calming. After a few deep breaths she looked for something to dry her face. Hung on the wall to the right of the bathroom mirror was a McGuffin Products paper towel dispenser. Psarah tore a towel from the bottom of the dispenser. Something on top glowed and then artered its form.

“Oooo, pretty, what is it”.

Psarah stood on her toes to get a better look. She reached for the glow. It changed color and turned itself inside out causing Psarah to pause.

“Maybe I shouldn’t touch it? But that has to be what Melvin and Ralph are looking for.”

She used a second paper towel to pick up the object as it vacillated in shape. She ran out of the bathrooms and found a cobblestone path. Past a retaining wall then a grove of oak trees Psarah saw Melvin, Ralph and Wayne Gibbous. She stopped and held the artifact above her head.

“Hey guys! Is this what we are looking for?”

Melvin furrowed his brow and shook his head in disapproval of the general intelligence of fish beings everywhere.

Ralph looked back toward Psarah.

“Yeah! Where did you find it?”

“It was just in the bathroom. I guess they accidentally left it behind.”

“Ayuh, fish ahen’t the brightest a creatuhes, ya know.”

Melvin put his notebook and pen away.

“Thank you for your help Mr Gibbous. I think we’ll be on our way before our friends return.”
