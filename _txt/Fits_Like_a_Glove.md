# Space 1979 | Fits Like a Glove
The street lights shone through the wide branches of elm trees. They made shadows across the hoods of cars, parked in rows on a bias, and the uneven brick sidewalks. The sound of slap bass and wah guitar rolled onto the street at a level that was at least three decibels in defiance of local noise ordinance. Rows of black iron railings lined the sidewalks. Just beyond was a deep green sign with gold-leaf lettering that read: Finley McNamara's Irish Pub. Below that was a poorly hung vinyl banner that advertised Seamus Blofeld and the Soul Scream Machine sponsored by Lobster Ale.
 
Behind the bar stood Finley McNamara himself. He nervously wiped down the bar top with a rag. It was so gray and misshapen that it may have been an old sock attempting a second chance at life as a bar towel. Meanwhile his usual crowd of patrons sat and drank off the last of a hard day’s work of regional sales and maybe insurance claims adjusting. Finley threw his ‘towel’ over one shoulder and approached a woman in a polyester pants suit and decade old hair style.
 
Carol Miller looked up from her cigarette with a sense of class superiority that only a real estate license can give. She answered back,

“I’ll have a Long Island Iced Tea and a Crab Pretzel.”

“Excellent choice. I’ll just chip one out of the freezer and throw it in the fryer while I get you your drink.”

The glow of neon bar signs and the harsh green cathode ray tube of a Russian arcade machine Intermittently pierced the dim light of the bar. Little green polygon pterodactyls swooped toward a little green Russian military tank shaped glow.
 
Enclosed in dark wood panelling and green bottle glass, Finley McNamara’s Irish Pub was its own parallel bubble of time. Even at two o’clock on a summer afternoon, the clock seemed permanently stopped at 1:45 AM.

Finley moved to the end of the bar while passively cleaning a glass.
 
“Another whiskey for ya-sir?”

With eyes as deep as time a lone cowboy looked up at Finley, gave him a tip of his hat and slid his glass back along the bar top. The cowboy had his back toward the door but he kept a clear view of it with the large mirror behind the bar.

Past the tables and dance floor was a very short red headed man who wore a fur coat and oversized sunglasses. He ended a song with a scream-embellished vocalization and an awkward little dance. If it wasn’t for the microphone in his hand and the band behind him, he would have appeared to be an insane homeless leprechaun.

“Ow! We’re Seamus Blofeld and the Soul Scream Machine. That was Hire a Dick off our latest album. Up next is Glovesy’s Got a Letter in the Mail. Make sure to tip your waitress and bartender, remember Lobster Ale drafts are half price till midnight.”

Seamus Blofeld’s Cork Ireland accent added an odd contrast to his motown funk style. His bass player Glovesy added– 
“Jetson you're fired!”
 
Then, with hands the size of dinner plates, he indulged himself in a short play slap bass solo.
 
The song started out straight and firmly on beat. It was a little too fast and too much like a march but without the snare rolls. Oddly the fourth beat of every measure seemed to not happen.

Seamus hollered back to Glovesy,
“You miss the turn around again and I’m docking yer pay!”

Glovesy slowed his pace enough to tuck his next root-note thumb-slap behind the beat of the kick drum. The measures grew to accommodate their missing fourth beat. Seamus released his stink eyed gaze and screamed his next vocal line into the microphone. Then he turned back to Glovesy.

“Dats it me boy! Keep it up an we’ll have em movin in no time!”

A blue glowing orb appeared between Glovesy and the drummer.

Glovesy slowed his pace a bit more and howled out, 
“Ow! I’ma gonna build a house.”

The orb increased in size and began to shimmer. The rhythm loosened up, Carol Miller couldn't help but get out of her seat and move to the dancefloor. Glovesy and his drummer Sticks locked into a deep funky pocket. So deep that time and space began to part. Strangs joined in on guitar. Adding a plinky rhythm with a seventh chord. Moreese tested a few peppy organ triads. With added confidence and heavy vibrato, he played a melodic flourish ending with a single held note.
 
“I’m in space!”

The atmosphere of the bar quavered with a blue shimmer so bright it could be seen reflected on the hoods of the cars parked outside. Glovesy’s last words echoed in the PA system right before the power cut out.

“That Dude’s a fish!”

In the dark, People bumped into each other knocking over the tables. The sound of shattering pint glasses cut through the backdrop of mumbled R’s, W’s, and missed footsteps. Carol and the other patrons, shuffled around in confusion, waiting for someone to do something.

Carol bumped into a tall man in a cheap brown suit. He smelled of cigars and reasonably priced used cars. He looked down into her eyes as a lecherous smile spread across his face.

When the lights came back on, Carol was on the dance floor. With her hands in the air she let out a horror movie scream and dropped her drink to the floor.

Standing in the spot Glovesy occupied moments ago was a custom-tailored suit with style so sharp that it could actually cut. The suit wasn’t the provocation of Carol Miller’s fear. Her fright came from the scaley mucus-covered skin wearing the suit. Cold lidless eyes looked to Carol with a; hello, what’s going on. Carol regained her composure and pummeled the velour-suited fish-beast with her purse.

“What’s wrong with you lady? Hey, what is this place? It kinda looks like the Ol’Barnacle.”

Without a word the Cowboy put down his whiskey and reached under his poncho, dust from a desert plain in some far off dimension brushed to the floor. His hand returned with a thick lariat made of hemp rope. With a few overhead swings he threw the loop of rope over the head of the confused fishman. With a single pull from both arms and full stride sidestep the scaly man-fish was dragged to the arcade machine.

“What the… Hey I didn’t do nothin!”

From out of a denim pocket appeared a silver coin. It caught a glint of light as it rolled into the coin slot. On the screen a little tank shot a single green pixel at a pterodactyl. The pterodactyl turned into a shower of pixels. The Cowboy manned the console controls. Up, up, down, down, left, right, fire. Fish, Cowboy, and machine all disappeared leaving a black greasy outline on the wall.

Carol Miller grabbed a few of the less sober patrons who were still quite shocked.

Hey, everyone! The exit is this way!

The cellar door flew open. Finley McNamara appeared at the top of the stairs. His face turned to a look of white hot anger.

“What’s happened to me bar!”

Seamus froze like a deer in headlights.

“I don’t know. The power went out then a fish and... and cowboy knocked everything over.”

“Where me video game machine! Why’s all this covered in goo!”

Moreese packed up his keyboard and walked out the door. He wore a giant purple velour top hat. It was his favorite hat. So he wore it a lot, even in grossly inappropriate settings, especially inappropriate settings. It was so ridiculous that people often just ignored him rather and mention the hat. As he walked through the argument, McNamara paid him no mind as if he were invisible.

“I don’t care! Where are me customers. Get out, all ah ya!”

Seamus looked around to see the bar empty of patrons with tables turned on their sides and broken pint glasses littering the floor. A trail of thin clear slim extended from the missing Glovesy to the black arcade machine shaped stain on the wall. His remaining fellow bandmates hurried to pack up all the gear.

Seamus queried,

“Where’s Glovesy?”

With his guitar in hand, Strangs grabbed Seamus by the arm.

“Come on, Seamus. Moreese had the right idea. Let’s scoot”.

“But we ain’t gonna get paid.”

McNamara fired back at Seamus

“Paid? I’m not paying ya for this!”

“You guys wouldn’t have to worry about that if you’d just join my Fatletics network. Just think of the customer base that we’d have! I could easily get you signed up tonight. Have I told you about the recruiting bonus and comp plan?

Sticks threw down the microphone cable that he was coiling.

You’ve never made a dime selling that garbage. Besides, we can’t practice at your house anymore cause your garage and basement is filled with it. If you spent half the time working that you spend trying to get out of work, you might go somewhere or at least be able to help me teardown the PA. I worked a full day cutting meat at the butcher shop…

You only work there three days a week.

Finley McNamara threw up his hands and yelled

I said all of you outta me bar!

## ***
Glovesy found himself behind the wheel of a strange craft. Before him was a long row of black and white keys, red and green toggle switches, and a bank of pull out handles.

“Oh no! I can’t drive this!”

Glovesy looked out through the windshield at a rapidly passing star field. Beside him was an odd fresh seafood like odor and heavy breathing. He turned to meet a very worried looking anthropomorphic salmon named Basil Pete.

“Hey, fish-man. What do I do?

From the passenger's seat, Basil Pete pointed out through the windshield at a fastly growing brown object. He shouted to Glovesy and readied himself for a crash.

“Look out for that asteroid!”
