# Rise the Pheonix
Deep in the shadow of Earth the minor trojan planetoid of Cruithne quietly flew. It wobbled through the Solaris  system on its bean shaped orbit. In the darkness of the small private docking port of Cruithne Logistics, a door clicked open only to shut a moment later. Two amber lights turned on with the pull of a switch. Behind the headlights was the silhouette of a sleek titanium-skinned machine, so dark blued by heat that it looked near black. It burned through the ink-like darkness. The turn of a nickel-plated brass key erupted a rhythm of explosions. With eight beats to a measure, the music of the machine filled the black with its roar. Another door opened with a click. This time, a soft light illuminated the inside of the roaring machine to reveal two men clad fully in denim. Large red glasses hid their eyes, save for a pattern of slits, allowing them to view the bright and the black as one.

Melvin Sideways prepared to pilot the next voyage. He sat behind the controls watching the gauges. Most of his flight experience had been gained in combat, during the Iridium Miner's Rebellion and Martian war for independence. Back then, nobody flew the old crates like Melvin. He was the kind of rogue who bent the rules and broke the ships. But his commanders knew any mission that Melvin was part of was bound to succeed, just maybe not as planned. After a few years of retirement from the Space Corps, Melvin opened a courier service. Although he didn't expect the excitement of a war-time pilot, at least he'd log more flight hours.

Ralph McCormick was the best navigator you could have. He checked a large paper map bearing a coffee cup stain down near the legend. Navigating the asteroid belt always took planning and a keen eye. During the Martian war for independence his ship was shot down, stranding him on Jupiter's moon Io. The pygmies of Io only stand half as tall as Earthlings and live much shorter lives. By the time Ralph was found, he'd mapped the entire sector by hand and taught the primitive people who lived there Euclidean geometry. Ralph also introduced them to other concepts. Most noted being: hot sauce, deep fat frying, and the domestication of a native lizard with large plump hind legs. Although not quite a generation had passed on Earth, history had made its mark on Io. To this day, the village chiefs still tell children the story of the man who came from the sky. Ralph McCormick, just trying to get home, birthed a culture and civilization.

Melvin looked to Ralph with a nod. Ralph opened a glove box full of 8-Track tapes lined in a neat row. He pulled out one heavy with wear. It bore a picture of a Mayan step pyramid with a heavily pointed font that spelled out, "Ziggurat". Smaller text below read, "The Illusion of Square". Ralph inserted the Ziggurat 8-Track tape into the player in the dashboard. He turned up the volume to match the music of the 6.6 liter V8 and twin afterburners.

"I'm just waiting for the temp to reach eighteen fifty. It's cold out there today."

Melvin revved the engine. With a hollow tubular whistle, air sucked into the intake, erupting as flame from the afterburners a second later. The sound of an Arp Odyssey synthesizer and fuzzed out loud electric guitar filled the cockpit. A drum fill broke the rhythm of the chorus, announcing the bridge before the second verse.

The map crinkled as Ralph folded it.

"Can we still have the T-Tops out?"

"Yeah, Dave fixed the radiation shield when he swapped out the catalytic converter for the test pipe. Besides we have the best denim this side of Jupiter."

The door ahead of the ship slowly scrolled up. Light shined in, eclipsing the front of the craft, gradually revealing a phoenix decal and ram air intake. A tap of the throttle cracked the engine to life once more. The engine tached down, the afterburners sparked with the crackle of partially combusted fuel. A smell of gunpowder and ethanol briefly filled the docking port.

"I have a course plotted to Dr Weissenburg's. But we'll have to stop for fuel on the way."

Melvin turned to Ralph, "As long as they have Lobster Ale I'm fine. Let's get out of here."

The engine temperature gauge reached one thousand eight hundred and fifty degrees. The air from the vents warmed the cockpit, despite the open roof. With the door now fully open ahead of the craft, Melvin mashed the throttle to the floor and released the handbrake. Air rushed into the V8 engine, spooling the turbo whine of twin afterburners. Flame erupted behind the craft, propelling the ship through the opening and into a bright starfield. After a straight shot out and a hard-banked left turn, Melvin slowed the Black Phoenix into a level cruise.

It was a sound like the feel of tree bark and a color only recognizable by beings with compound eyes.

"I told you nothing past 1980!"

A large man with dark skin wore a denim tracksuit. He wrestled for control of the console with a short, petite woman with brightly colored hair.

"How are you so strong?"

"Ever heard of Fatletics?

The sleeve of her oversized denim jacket caught the stabilizer override control, pulling it to the 껐다(kkeuda) position.

"I just want to see if Regency England is like all the novels I've read."

The floor turned on its side. A walnut finished coat rack slid across the floor and knocked the man from the control panel. His legs dangled as he held onto the console supports.

"I'm from there, it's not that romantic."

Outside the craft, if you could call it that, the ship randomly changed shape, popped in and out of existence, and moved through time, space, and across dimension. Never in the history of the universe had a less stable mass attempted objective reality.

"I don't think this is even your ship! What are these controls labeled in? Korean?"

Hand over hand she turned a wheel, marked "past" with a sticky note over the original markings, as fast as she could. Above the controls, the display flipped past the number 1985.

"I told you. I don't take no hitchhikers and I don't go to the past."

He used the stabilizer override control to pull himself off the floor. The handle bent under his weight as the craft righted itself.

An explosion of sparks showered from the console. Both of them were knocked to the floor. The display above the controls stopped on 1979. The vessel ceased its fluctuations and coalesced into a form not far off from an interplanetary modular freight transport. The scene outside was heavy with traffic across acres of flat tarmac. A marquee in the distance advertised chicken fried steak and country music.

"Get Out!"

"What?"

"That's Doktor What to you."

"No, that's not what I meant."

Doktor What grabbed the young woman and forced her out the door.

"Keep the jacket! I never really liked that one."

Before she could turn around the door to the craft shut behind her. With a sound like the rubbing of corduroy between a plump set of thighs, Doktor What's ship vanished.

Looking ahead from between two freight transports the young girl found herself alone.

"Where am I, some kind of space truck stop?"

Bask in the glow of the check engine light

The vocalist was interrupted by a left-handed drum fill, loud snare crack, followed by a dead pause and sizzling guitar solo.

Melvin reached down to the dashboard and shut out the lights.

"What's wrong?"

"I saw something in the rearview mirror. Let’s hope it didn't see us."

Behind the Black Phoenix was a bright colored square ship with two afterburners set high. Barely visible through the windscreen was something not quite human. It was dressed in a well-tailored blue velour suit with a frilled cravat. Any closer and they would have heard screechy organ music and seen the scaly skin.

Melvin adjusted the rearview mirror in frustration and let out a deep zenful sigh.

"I hate these mod punks. Try to keep track, I’m going off course."

Full throttle and a jerk of the wheel pulled the craft into a sideways roll, then around the left side of the nearest asteroid. It took both hands to turn the wheel to the opposite lock position. Melvin banked the craft around the right side of the next asteroid, with a near engine flame out and slight tach back left. It was a move known in the space corps as the Melvin Chicane.

With the Black Phoenix pulled back to the level, Melvin turned the headlamps and marker lights back on.

"Alright, where are we?"

"Ready to stop for gas, that's where. That move used most of our fuel. Two more asteroids then on to the transport stop. You'll see a flat topped planetoid fifteen degrees left and thirty degrees above our current axis."

A second glance at the rearview mirror turned into a longer moment. Melvin rolled his eyes and let out another sigh.

"Oh no, not this guy."

"What, I thought you lost them."

"No, this is much more annoying."

Melvin pulled the Black Phoenix to a stop on a small grey asteroid. Red and blue lights strobed through the rear windshield.

Ralph readied the papers that were clipped behind the visor,

"Hopefully he doesn't make this take any longer than it has to."

The Shadow of an overweight man appeared in the lights. It swaggered proudly toward them like an overfed duck, drunk on government appointed power. It slowly grew until it blocked the light from the driver's side window. A high power flashlight clicked on a few inches from Melvin's face. Brown leather patches capped the shoulders of a belted gray sweater. Despite the look of woolen chainmail, the uniform was slimming enough to convey some authority. However, a helmet– the shape of an upturned flower pot with a visor– did not. A voice bellowed out from between the visored pot and belted wool-mail, with all the charm of an afternoon at the Department of Motor Vehicles.

"License and registration, please."

"Turn that thing off Jeff! You know my paperwork is up to date."

"License and registration."

"You were a boner in the space corps and you're still a boner now. Here, it looks exactly the same as it did when you pulled us over last week."

Melvin handed Officer Jeff a red vinyl pouch filled with neatly folded paperwork.

"You see, that's the problem. Your paperwork is too good."

Jeff looked through the paperwork, carelessly dropping a few pages in the icy dust of the asteroid.

"I hope you haven't been tempted to reinstall that anti-lag system or disable your emissions equipment again?

"Come on, Jeff, we're just trying to stop for fuel."

"That's not what I saw, Mr Space Acrobat. Don't make me have this thing hauled in for inspection."

"We both know you've got better things to do today. Did you make your quota yet?"

"Melvin, back off. Don't forget what happened the last time you argued with Jeff?"

"You two sit tight. I'm gonna call this in."

As the shape of modern law enforcement shrunk into the light. Melvin drummed nervously on the steering wheel.

"I'm sick of this. I'm not waiting for him to take his sweet old time."

"But what can we do about it?"

"We are going to get that Lobster Ale and he's going to figure it out for himself."

"But he has all our paperwork."

Melvin restarted the Black Phoenix and raced the engine.

"No, Jeff has a copy of our paperwork."
