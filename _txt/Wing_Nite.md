# Space 1979 | Wing Nite
“That’s a good spot, between those two transports.”

Slowly the Black Phoenix moved from cruise to a near vertical descent. The landing gear deployed as the afterburners slowed to a stop. The explosive rhythmic roar gave way to a whine, that descended in pitch, until it in turn gave way to the pings of shrinking metal. The radiation shield faded out and a young girl approached the ship. She was short, petite, and not at all in appropriate dress for the conditions at the transport stop. She has an oversized denim jacket draped over her shoulders that is clearly not her’s. She pushed back a bit of brightly colored hair from in front of her face. She attempted to address Melvin through the open pilot’s side window but he interrupted her before the words left her mouth.

“I’m sorry honey but we’re not into that sort of thing.”

“Wait, what?”

“We’re only stopping for fuel, we aren’t looking for a good time. Try that guy over there that looks like he hasn’t eaten a vegetable in the last decade.”

“No… No, I’m not that kinda girl! I’m lost. I’m not sure where or even when I am.”

“It’s 1979 honey, Carter is president of that dump they call Earth and this here is a refuel station for interplanetary modular freight transports.”

“I’m still not sure what’s going on. He just left me here, I’ve got no clue how to get back.”

Ralph leaned in.

”Don’t mind sourpuss here, we’re about to get wings and beer. This place is pretty busy, we have to queue for refuel and flight inspection, so we’ll be here awhile. You can join us if you want."

“Thanks, my name is Psarah by the way. Please tell me it's chicken wings that they serve here. I’ve had a pretty strange day.”

## ***
Inside Ol’76 diner country music played from a jukebox in a corner next to the hallway. While fryers browning frozen food mingled grease with a cloud of cigarette smoke that extended from the ceiling to about waist high. The worst part of this rustic backdrop was the music, it was modern country music. The kind that comes stamped out in a single afternoon, with session musicians from a Martian trojan planetoid known as New Nashville.

Melvin and Ralph usually ate at the counter. Since they had a guest. Ralph had the hostess seat them, in a booth near a window, with an ample view of the busy tarmac outside. Psarah sat down opposing Melvin and Ralph. The three stared at plastic laminated menus without speaking.

Melvin broke the silence with a slurp of his coffee through a thick bristling mustache.

“If you want something that doesn’t start out frozen your best bet is wings or breakfast.”

Psarah looked up from her menu with the look of confusion that she had been using most of the afternoon. The atmosphere of the diner parted to reveal a dark haired waitress. She may have been an exotic dancer, in a past life, before becoming a single mother. She spoke in a colloquial accent without moving her lips. The three stared blankly at their ventriloquist waitress wondering what happened to her dummy. Melvin handed his menu back to the waitress ordering for the group without consultation.

“We’ll have three dozen wings, half hot, half mild, blue cheese, celery, and a pitcher of lobster ale.”

After another bout of mumbles, while scratching at a notepad with a pen that was mostly out of ink, the waitress was consumed by the diner fog. A few moments later from out of the diner-grease, cigarette-ether emerged three pint glasses and a pitcher filled with a pale but slightly red ale. When the pitcher of beer was sat down on the table. Some of the foamy blonde head spilled past the top and ran down onto the table. Melvin grabbed the glasses and carefully poured a beer for each occupant of the booth.
Psarah watched Melvin skillfully fill each glass, tilted just so, until they were full with the perfect head on top.

Psarah asked,

“It’s not made with real lobster is it?”

Melvin retorted with a laugh,

”No, it’s only the recipe of an old sea captain from Maine.”

“I’m sorry that Melvin mistook you for a prostitute. It’s not uncommon out here. A lot of young girls think that they can hitchhike from Earth and Venus out to the Trans Neptunian belt and marry some rich old fart. Sadly Mars is about as far as most of them get.”

“Wait, Mars? Venus? Where are we? I remember the Moon landing but not all this.”

Melvin finished a long draft of his ale and answered,

”We’re in the asteroid belt on our way to Mars. Humanity has been multi-planetary ever since the Amish colonized Venus, almost sixty years.”

“I don’t know what to do. I want to get back to Earth but it doesn’t sound like I’m going to get back to the Earth that I left.”

“Then why don’t you come with us?”

“Ralph! We can’t take her with us!”

“Sure we can, we’ll pass by Earth at some point. It won’t be the first time that we’ve taken some poor girl back to earth. Psarah, you're coming with us.”

“Okay, I don’t think I have a better option unless I run into Doktor What. I’m sure he’s long gone by now.”

Their conversation was interrupted by the welcome arrival of baskets full of hot wings. The three were mostly silent as they ate. Except for Melvin, he tried to talk in between wiping his mustache and sucking hot sauce off his fingers. An action which fully disgusted Ralph and made him shudder. Psarah laughed at the spectacle. She finally felt herself calming down after a long strange morning.

Through the diner haze appeared the shape of modern law enforcement. Officer Jeff wedged his way into the booth. Pushing Psarah uncomfortably toward the window. Jeff had brought his own pint glass to the table. He took the pitcher from the table and poured the rest of the Lobster Ale for himself without asking.

“Ow! Who is this guy and why is he smashing me into the window?”

Jeff ate a chicken wing from Ralph’s plate. He decided that the best time to introduce himself was while his mouth was still full.

“Officer Geoffrey Copeland, Terrestrial Planet Highway Patrol.”

“Do you two know this guy?”

Melvin rolled his eyes trying to ignore the situation. He drank his beer, looking out the window to see if the Black Phoenix was ready. He muttered something under his beer-foam covered mustache.

”Why are they taking so long today?”

Ralph spoke up to add some clarity to the situation,

“The three of us all fought together in the Martian War for Independence.”

“So… you all fought for Mars?”

“Oh no… We fought for Earth, in the Space Corps. And boy did we lose to those rebel miners. We were lucky to make it to the end of the war with our lives.”

Jeff added with a mouth still full of food,

“We might have had a chance if the corps best navigator hadn’t spent the last half of the war stranded on Io. You spent more time teaching those weirdos to make wings out of lizards than you spent in combat.”

Melvin, deep in introspective thought, slowly returned to the conversation with a shudder of disgust, “Just the thought of that place still creeps me out. I’m not sure what was worse, the food that you taught them to make or the giant terracotta statue that they made of you.”

“Hey, it wasn’t that bad. That lizard skin got a nice crisp after I taught them to make palm oil.

Psarah gave her plate of wings a distrusting look, then pushed it to the center of the table, draping her napkin over top.

Anyway, that was a long time ago, we were just looking for an easy paycheck and the excitement of space travel. A bunch of kids were never going to beat those miner’s dream of a free Mars. What are you doing here, anyway? I thought you were on patrol.”

“I was. You two must have some friends in high places. Dispatch wouldn’t let me chase after you. But… I only needed one more citation to meet my quota and here it is.”

Jeff casually slid some papers over to Melvin.

“You can’t prove that, you can’t prove anything.”

“I don’t have to. Nothing legal sparks like that on take-off. I’ve already spoken with the inspection crew foreman. If you try to fight this citation, all that I’ll need is the fight inspection report and the mechanic’s invoice.”

Melvin’s face fell into his hands,”Those guys are the worst mechanics in all of Solaris.”

Responding to the recent turn of events, Ralph took an opportunity to flag down the waitress and ordered a second pitcher of beer.

“They’re good enough to install functioning emissions equipment. I thought about having you impounded for non compliance. But then I decided that I’d rather drink than do paperwork.”

Like a ghost on the moors, the waitress appeared from the diner fog with a fresh pitcher of Lobster Ale. Jeff immediately picked up the pitcher, with his full hand though the handle, as if it were a giant pint glass. He took a long drink right from the pitch, wiped his mouth with his sleeve and walked away.

Psarah, still in shock from the spectacle of an off duty Officer Jeff,“That guy’s a real jerk.”

Ralph watched what could have been his next pint of Lobster ale be consumed by the fog,“He used to be way worse. Jeff has actually mellowed out a lot.”

The paging system crackled to life,“Gate 417 your vessel has completed flight inspection.”

Melvin stood up from the booth to put on his denim jacket.

“Come on, it sounds like they’re ready for us. Let’s get out of here. Besides, I don’t want to be late to meet Dr Weissenburg.”

“I’ll take Psarah with me to go pay our bill. I think I’ll tell the waitress that it’s Jeff’s birthday.”

“That’s a fantastic idea, I hope the whole staff sings that dumb song to him. I’ll check on the Black Phoenix and see what extra money Jeff just cost us.”
