# Space 1979 | Shadow of Olympus Monte
Most of the Martian colonists live in the foothills of the Tharsis Monte. With the shadow of the great Olympus Mons dominating the north western sky. Dr Weissenburg grew up in a small Martian colony near Pavonis Mons, known as Patera. An isolated mountain village dug into the side of Ulysses Tholus known for its clock making, tall beautiful blonde women, and greenhouse potatoes. He was a man of wild ideas and awkward social mannerism. Most of his wild ideas involved writing grant requests for more funding. Nobody sent more papers back to Earth for peer review than Dr Weissenburg. Regardless of how ridiculous his research had been. It had funded a beautiful state of the art campus on Mars. With Dr Weissenburg’s hard work, Tharsis Montes University had grown to be the most respected institution in all of Solaris. Despite the fact that nobody could figure out what kind of creature their mascot was and that their football team, the Raging Ursalopes, had never won a game off world.

Evan had been working all morning at the Weissenburg Applied Research Laboratory. Or “WARTS” as the sign currently read after being defaced yet again. Evan stared at the lab console screen. Line by line he reviewed the data from the last experiment.

Gerg put away his black marker and self satisfied grin and walked into the lab.

“Well, well, look who finally made it down here. I haven’t seen you in over two weeks. What’s so funny?”

“Nothing.”

"Whatever, I could really use some help. I’ve been down here all morning. Something's not right, we’re not receiving any data from the cube. I’m out of ideas. At this point I’d try anything. Even a bad idea that leads to something meaningful would be better than this."

“Bad ideas I can help you with, I’m full of those.”

There was a soft knock on the door. Not the type that asked permission. It was the knock of someone who was going to quietly interrupt you no matter what. Pam Robinson leaned in through the partially open door. She wore tortoise horn-rimmed glasses and a white lab coat. Her head was crowned with sandy brown feathers that crested toward the back.

Pam spoke in an apologizing tone, “Evan, Dr Weissenburg is on the phone, can you take the call? I don’t quite have the patience to talk with him today.”

“I’ll be right there. It seems our data from the last experiment turned out inconclusive, so there’s not much else that we can do here.”

Pam narrowed her eyes in disapproval, “What do you mean by inconclusive?”

“Well, there’s no data. There’s just nothing.”

Pam snaps back, “Why did I have to pick you as my lab partner? Your last paper was a disaster and now this. I thought that if we were working with the Weissenburg Cube we’d have an easier time. Apparently I was wrong.”

“But there are some really great uses f—

“Evan, I’m not even sure he’s read our, I mean your, paper.

Pam entered the lab and stomped toward the experiment-lab’s isolation chamber. Her feathers ruffled, which made the back of her neck look like a pinecone.

“Gerg, can you hit the emergency shutoff?”

At the other end of the lab was a big steel door like a restaurant walk-in cooler. Only instead of signs that stated: employees must wash hands, what date to throw the chicken out, or whose day off is when, all the signs on this door warned of impending death if you happened to enter at the wrong time.

Evan interrupted, ”I’m not so sure that’s a good idea.”

“My ass is on the line as well as you two. We’ve been studying this all semester and I haven't seen in there once! Evan, I hope you have some kind of answer for Dr Weissenburg. I’m going in to see for myself what is wrong.”

On the wall next to the console was a red mushroom shaped button. Gerg pressed it with the palm of his hand. The button made a satisfying click sound. The low humming sound that all of them had tuned out, broke into a cold awkward silence. The kind of silence that distorted department store paging systems are employed to cover up with terrible music.

“I’m not really sure what this experiment even is?”

“If you’d come to class Greg, you’d know that we are running a simulated universe. I copied my notes for you.”

“Awe, come on guys, you know it’s Gerg, Gerg Stahlworth IV.”

“Yeah, yeah, we’ve all been to the Stahlworth botanical building. Some of us are paying our own way to be here. Pam’s been trying to help you, but you just want to mope in the dorm until the Ursalopes win a game. Everyone knows that we’ve got the worst team in all of Solaris.”

“Just stop, you guys know I’m here by my own merit. Besides, they won last season—”

Evan shook his head in disgust and lowered his brow into an open hand, ”Nobody here cares about football. You know guys, I better go see what Doctor Weissenburg wants.”

In the office next to the lab was a rotary dial telephone a color somewhere between a hearing aid and a medical prosthesis. It battled a mountain of papers and an overturned pencil holder for control of the remaining space on the desk’s blotter. Dr Heinrich Weissenburg believed that only a clear mind that had brought forth its ideas into reality could truly produce such clutter. It wasn’t a mess on the desk, it was the natural entropy of expressed ideas. Making sure he disturbed as little as possible, Evan picked up the phone on Dr Weissenburg’s desk.

“Hello, Doctor Weissenberg?”

“Who am I speaking with?”

The Dr’s thin German accent complimented the direct nature of his speech. He tended to explode into the conversation with an interjection, then hiss to a stop like a kettle off the boil.

“This is Evan from down in the lab. I’m sorry that I kept you waiting. I’ve been down here all morning reviewing the file. By the way, did you happen to read my paper on differential phase shift keying with a quad bilateral array?”

“Ja, Edvin, I remember, That’s not what I’m calling for. ”Don’t bother reviewing the latest data set. You’ll find it corrupt. As we have lost the cube.”

“Yeah, um Dr. it’s Evan. Wait, lost? That explains the lack of data. But how could it be lost?”

“I believe the experiment was stolen shortly after we initialized the batch file.”

“Oh, I guess... Um, we can’t really continue your research without the cube. Do you have any idea wha—

This afternoon… I’ll be down to meet some men that I’ve hired to find the cube. Keep everyone out of the isolation chamber until we arrive.”

Oh, um yeah, okay. Keep everyone out.”

“Ja, Eduard, correct. And if you want a grade please try something better than a toggle switch with ah fancy name. As I said, I’ll be down this afternoon. Until we arrive do not enter the isolation chamber, especially Pam an Greg”

The line clicked dead. Dr Weissenburg often bailed out of a conversation once his own ideas had been conveyed. He was the social analog of a jet pilot evading a crash. Unsure of what happened, Evan held the phone for a minute before hanging up. Confused and defeated he walked back to the lab.

Pam took a few more steps toward the door before being stopped by Gerg.

“Yeah, all I care about right now is what’s behind this door.”

Gerg looked at Pam with a face akin to a bichon frise extracting meaning from a television police drama, “No, seriously Pam. What was in there?”

Pam placed her hand on the door’s handle, “It was a crystal of compressed time folded into a four dimensional lattice.”

“How or why would you turn time into lettuce?”

Pam rolled her eyes at Gerg as she turned the handle and opened the isolation chamber door, “No, lattice you meathead. It’s a grid of time arranged in a tesseract shape to enclose a tiny universe, parallel to our own. So that we can study it. You really have missed way too much class Gerg.”

“That sounds like a really convoluted way to make an expensive snow globe. How did Dr Weissenburg do it?”

“The same way that we do everything around here.”

“Lasers?”

As the isolation chamber door closed, Evan returned from his call with Doctor Weissenburg.

“Pam, Gerg, I have some bad news for you guys. Our experiment was stolen.”

“Oh, um, yeah, she just went in there.”

“Ah, fork! The Doctor just told me that he really doesn’t want anyone in there.”

It was now Gerg’s turn to laugh at Evan,”You really need to learn to properly swear if you don’t want to sound like a child.”

Birds by nature are creatures of wide open spaces. Even though the Birds of Tharsis hadn’t ruled the martian skies for centuries Pam Robinson still had instinct. However, in an enclosed space a frightened bird will always smash into every available surface until even a reasonably sized room seems no larger than a shoebox. After an immense amount of noise the isolation chamber door was thrown open.

“Oh my God! Everything in here is covered in goo!”

Evan and Gerg turned their heads in time to see Pam reappear at the isolation chamber door. Her right hand was covered in a thin clear sticky goo.

“That’s it! I need a beer!”

Evan tried his best to hold back his laughter, “Are you alright? We could go to Joe’s? It’s Tuesday so Lobster Ale drafts should be half off. I can always go for wings.”

Pam looked at her goo covered hand, ”I’m fine. I just need to wash up first. Everything in there is covered in this stuff and smells of old seafood. Joe’s sounds like a great plan but I’ll have a burger instead. My hands have been messy enough today.”

Gerg rounded his shoulders and slouched into his chair, “I think I’ll just go back to the dorm.”

“Come on Gerg, you haven’t been out in weeks. Besides I need someone else to throw darts with.”

“What about Evan?”

“Evan!? Oh no, he’s the reason they had to move the dart board away from the hall leading to the bathrooms. Come on, they just put the latest Ziggurat album on the jukebox. At least come have a beer with us. Besides, Joe’s has those cheddar scones you like. I won’t see you sulking in your room eating potatoes one more night.”

Deep inside a simulated universe, that seemed an infinite expanse of space to its inhabitants, but just happened to fit into your average macrame-owl tote bag, Two scientists reviewed the data from their last experiment. In white lab coats they sat and stared at a screen full of numbers and symbols.

“Do you really think we are going to find it this time?”

“Probably not, it's really unlikely.”

“It sure is fun destroying the smallest parts of our observable universe and watch it coalesce into new forms.”

“Yeah, I could write grants and papers on this for the rest of my career.”

“I know, it sure beats working in the landfill mines. You see here at line seventy six, we just missed a collision this time.”

Most sentient beings live under the impression that reality is one continuous membrane with their dimension squarely placed on top. In truth, space is like a folded white linen with a coffee stain made of time bled completely through to the table. Earlier that day, above the next fold in a higher order dimension. The unblinking eyes of a humanoid fish stared into the void of a softly glowing cube. Like a child in a blanket fort with a flashlight pointed up into their own face. The glow brought out deep shadows past the edges of its scales.

"Basil, Basil! Did you see that tosser in the black bird that just cut us off? Basil?"

"What, uh… Sorry I missed it."

"How could you? He ran us off into the space dust! Put that thing away. It can't be good to touch anything that glows like that. I’ll be quite glad when we are rid of it."

Basil shook off the last of his daydream. As he set the cube down on the van’s floor it changed shape and intensity, "Calm down Alan. You’ll have yourself set right, once we’ve paid a visit to our good friend Wayne. It’s just a quick pop on are way."

“Okay, but let’s be quick about it. We need a lot of practice for our next gig.”

Alan steered the van back onto the highway and turned the radio back on. Staccato guitar chords and bright squeaky organ blared out into outer space. A vocalist joins a melody plucked out on a sitar, Someday I’m gonna make that bird my baby...
