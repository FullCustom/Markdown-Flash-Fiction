# `Life on the Edge of Sol`

## ---

`Out amongst the Trans-Neptunian belt are the big houses where the rich live. A belt of minor trojans, asteroids, and planetoids beyond Neptune, Custom built for the major businessmen of Solaris. Although there is no physical barrier the neighborhood functioned as a gated community. A gate of taxes, high real estate prices, and sheer opulence keeps most of the riff raff out. The only trouble makers that they couldn’t keep out mostly had the names Chad, Brad, Chet, and Bret. With parents that should have known better than to spoil their children.`  
`In the parlor of Sedna Hall sat Lord Nevel Friday and Lawrence Tunnbottom. Lord Friday was dressed in a suit made of the latest carbon kevlar faraday suede. The small room was lit by an antique mica shade lamp and a window with sparse treatments. The blue hued light of the outside planetoid illuminated his profile, overwhelming the small orange glow of the art deco lamp. Between them a low table held a Japanese tea serving, with hand painted cherry blossoms and a tray of cucumber sandwiches. Lawrence Tunnbottom reached for a second sandwich while Lord Friday talked at him, uninterested in any reply.`  
`Nevel got up from his seat without excusing himself. Crumbs of white bread rolled off his suede jacket and onto the carpet of the parlor floor. Nevel stepped over to the window. He mumbled to himself,`  
`“This lighting is giving me a headache.”`   
`In front of the window, he waved his hand from right to left. The scene changed from a blue hued starfield to a rolling English country lawn with thatch roof houses, a garden, and even a river with a stone arch bridge. The temper of the room’s lighting changed from clinical to inviting. A tone which was much closer to the light from the art deco mica shade lamp next to the teapot, but a bit more yellow. Nevel returned to his conversation with Lawrence, oblivious that he was smashing crumbs into the carpet as he sat down.`

`Lord Nevel Friday would like you to think that he was a self made entrepreneur. The truth was that he’d married into money and title. Although he had spent most of the family’s original wealth on his compulsion for oddities and curiosities. He had been lucky enough to have holdings in iridium futures during the miner’s rebellion. The overnight explosion of iridium prices during the miner’s rebellion created the perfect opportunity to replace the family’s wealth and more. His whole family resented him for losing all their original lands and holding back on Earth. But his modest investment in iridium futures had exploded to a level that afforded opulence that they had never dreamed of. He held it over them at every chance he had. Their new home, out in the Trans-Neptunian belt in, Sedna Hall was built with all Lord Friday’s own money. Nevel didn’t care if most of the old money still lived back on Earth. He had no interest in going back to that dumpy dirty planet he’d grown up on.`

`Lawrence Tunnbottom didn’t dress as well as Nevel. Which was mostly do to the fact the Lawrence's best suits were Lord Friday’s old suits. Adjusting a suit constructed for Lord Nevel Friday’s panda like built to the weasley shape of Lawrence Tunnbottom would push the limits of any tailor. The kind of tailors that Lawrence could afford most certainly had limits.`   
`Lawrence and Lord Friday had known each other for a long time. Their friendship began on a dirty schoolyard in Brooklyn, back when they were just Larry and Nevel. Nevel with the build of a lazy vegetarian bear and the hand strength of a ripe avocado was a natural target for bullies. The greatest turning point in Nevel Friday’s life was the day he met Lawrence.`   
`If the fog hadn't trapped in the smog, it might have been a sunny afternoon. Lying on the ground was a desiccated old stick. All it’s bark long rubbed off like antler velted by the trampling of children's feet. Nevel picked up the stick and drew a circle in the dirt. Looking at Larry He pulled five small polished stones from his pocket and tossed them in the dirt ring.`  
`“Okay, I’ll show you how to play knucklebones. First you pick one up and toss it. Then try to pick another one up before you catch the first one.”`  
`Larry watched as Nevel expertly played just has he described.`   
`“So, now what?”`  
`“Here, why don’t you give it a try?”`  
`Larry gave the first rock a toss. It lazily lumbered over his shoulder, bounced in the dirt, and fell down a crack.`  
`“I’m sorry I’ve never been any good at throwing or catching things”`  
`“Don’t worry about it. I make em with my rock tumbler. We can still play with four.”`  
`Nevel threw a stone with greenish swirls on it in the air. Before it returned to his hand, it was caught by Jerry Haverford and thrown over the fence. Then he kicked dirt though the circle, scattering the rest of the stones. Big Jerry Haverford wasn’t big for his age, but he was two years older than his classmates.`  
`Larry stepped forward,`   
`“Hey, whatcha do that for!”`  
`Jerry pushed Larry to the ground,`   
`“Maybe cause Nevel’s family is so poor they couldn’t afford the rest of the letters to spell his name right.”`  
`Larry dusted himself off while Nevel tried to find a few of his stones. He put a dull red stone in his pocket and looked up at Jerry,`   
`“That doesn’t make any sense?”`  
`Big Jerry grabbed Nevel’s Rabbit’s Foot necklace from his neck and ripped it from it’s chain.`   
`“What’s this?”`  
`Nevel Answered,`   
`“It’s my lucky rabbit’s foot, my uncle got it from a rabbit that he caught in the woods.”`  
`“That doesn’t sound very lucky for the rabbit. I bet that night’s chicken dinner had four drumsticks.”`  
`Jerry wound up to throw the rabbit’s foot over the fence. He was stopped by Larry’s fist. One punch to the throat knocked Jerry to the ground. Nevel’s rabbit’s foot rolled from the bully’s hand and into the remains of the dirt circle.`  
`There sure was no better way to apply for a job as henchman than a throat punch, knockout. With the immediate acceptance of Larry’s application. Nevel began his slow climb to power.`  
`“I’ve never seen anybody knocked out cold like that. You sure are terrible at knucklebones but do you want to play tomorrow?”`

`After several false starts, Lawrence was finally able to interject in their single sided conversation,`   
`“But why didn’t you just buy it from them?”`  
`“Haven’t you been listening? I told you, I spoke with Weissenburg himself. He wouldn’t sell. I even tried to go around him. I met with the Dean of Tharsis University, I offered a large donation so they could maybe hire some real players for their team. I even offered to find them a better mascot. It seems they don’t actually care about football.”`  
`“Uh, that’s odd. A university that doesn’t care about football.”`  
`“Nevermind, we don’t need to understand the ways of Mars. I just want you to get that cube. I know the other Estate Holders on the tour have read about Dr Weissenburg’s work in Scientific Solarian. I need something other than cheap wine and canapes to hold their attention at the party next week.”`  
`“Well what do you want me to do about it? Also isn’t Ziggurat ending their tour at Sedna Hall that night?”`  
`“We’re the cream that rose from the sewers to the top. They don’t care about the garbage we’ve brought with us. Everyone will be too busy talking to Earl What’s-his-face since he’s first chair violin in the Solarian Symphony.”`  
`Nevel scowls and gives a dismissive wave of his hand as he failed to remember that Daryl Kelvin is the Earl of Mercury’s name.`  
`I don’t care how you do it, just get that cube. You can take the Kestrel. I’ll have Honest Pawns on Fifth write a receipt of purchase as a backup story. They’ll put just about anything on carbon paper for a Rand.”`  
`Nevel threw a set of keys at Lawrence. His hands instantly rise as if to defend from a simultaneous knife attack and bee swarm. The keys fell to the floor while a white rabbit’s foot keychain bounced behind. Most of the hair had rubbed off over the years but you could still clearly tell that some rabbit somewhere had a most unlucky day.`   
`“You’ve been able to take out a man with one punch since we were boys, but you still can’t catch.”`  
`When Lawrence stood up with the keys in hand, a large velvet coin purse hit him in the middle of his chest.`  
`“Ow! Now you're just messing with me.”`  
`“There’s a few Rand in there if you need any help. Just get that cube. Sedna Hall has never had this much attention. I’d like to hold it for more than fifteen minutes.”`  
`“I’ll come up with something.“`  
`“You usually do, don’t you.”`  
`With his orders, Lawrence Tunnbottom left the room. Lord Nevel Friday stared into the tall glass cabinet, standing opposite of him, in the parlour. From top to bottom it held the greatest curiosities of Solaris, a lifetime of ruin and success. Nevel walked over, opened the door, and made a place for Dr Weissenburg’s cube on the middle shelf.`
