# Welcome to Tales of the Absurd by Radio Cruithne

Welcome to **Radio Cruithne**, a cozy corner of the internet where imagination thrives through short stories. Here, we weave tales of mystery, adventure, and wonder, crafted in Markdown and delivered with a touch of cosmic charm. I'm hoping to open submissions in November. This month I am working on monetization. We have our first sponsor with Libro.fm, this month they are Book Shop Day. [When customers sign up for a new monthly membership with code BOOKSHOPDAY, we’ll give them two bonus audiobooks!](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=25361&awinaffid=2579497&ued=https%3A%2F%2Flibro.fm%2Fmembership%3Fmp%3DBOOKSHOPDAY)
