# Space 1979 | Chicken of Space
Deep in a layer of ice, long forgotten by time, was an old rusty can. Although the label was weathered it still clearly read; Ice-Star Farms, Wild Caught Europa Pink Salmon. Above the ice an old ice fishing house was busy with activity. Even though no fisherman had been seen for a long, long time.

The ice fishing houses of Europa were not like the little huts used back on Earth. The ice of Europa was plenty thick enough to support a large commercial building. The giant ice fishing houses dotted the surface opposite Jupiter. Most were large permanent concrete and steel structures. A few were movable with a towering drill rig towed behind. Ice-Star Farms had thought they had found the perfect solution to feeding the growing number of newly multi planetary humans. By introducing salmon and tuna to Europa they’d created the largest fish farm in the Sol system. For decades fisherman from Earth flocked to the ice fishing water-world to enjoy the best catches ever known to humanity. It wasn’t long before the colony began to support other industry. One group of fishermen from Maine even opened up an Avant Garde Jazz night club called the Rusty Barnacle. It was paradise and every year the fish were larger and the catch more numerous. But it wasn’t to last. With a collapse in iridium prices the asteroid belt miners went on strike. When the strike turned into a full on rebellion and the Solarian economy headed toward failure. The giant fish farming moon went bust. Never again would men in plaid shirts and ice flecked beards gaze at the blue light of Earth from the water-moon of Jupiter.

## ***
The nights of Europa aren’t like Earth’s. They’re longer, darker, and colder. The days are bright, bold, and crisp. A permanent winter with a spring that was always another six weeks away.

Basil Pete entered the Rusty Barnacle. He brushed the newly fallen snow from his custom-tailored blue crushed-velour suit and straightened his cravat. The sound of Avant Garde Jazz filled every crack and shadow. Forcing the cold from the old cement ice fishing house and pushing the long lonely night out with it. Seated at a booth in the far corner was a man wearing a long coat, a brimmed hat and a convenient shadow to cloak his identity. There was a large bottle and two low wide glasses waiting on the table. Basil spoke quietly as he sat down. Then poured a drink for himself.

“Larry! I told you not to meet me here. You know you got decked by some Scombridaedian punks last time.”

“I can handle myself Basil. Besides, I came prepared this time.”

Lawrence Tunnbottom opened his long black faraday tweed coat to show Basil a few barbed hooks and a net.

“Put those away, man! You know better than to bring those here. It’s bad enough for just you to be here.”

Lawrence closed his coat and flipped his collar forward, closing the gap between his coat and hat. With the corners of his collar once again hiding his face. Lawrence leaned in toward Basil Pete, making sure to speak quietly.

“I couldn’t get ahold of you. Do you want some more work or not?”
“Sorry about that, we’ve been busy in the garage. We almost have the van running perfectly again. Yeah, man we’ll take whatever job you’ve got. The gang is itching to get off world.

“Alright, Nevel needs something new for is parlour. Sedna Hall finally made it into the Trans-Neptunian Parade of Homes. He needs something bold, something that will impress the other estate holders. Friday’s estate is the last home on the tour so he’s hosting a big after party. He has his eye on a curiosity in the Tharsis Montes University lab.”

“The boys and I’ll have no trouble in Tharsis. We were there last month. We crashed a homecoming party. It was a bit of a downer but there were some sweet birds there. We had a real gas, but the van broke down on the way back. What’s this job pay anyhow?”

“Ten iridium rand now, and twenty upon delivery.”

“How very generous of his Lordship. The boys an I will be happy to take on the job. We shan’t fail you.”

Lawrence threw an envelope across the table to Basil,

”The money and your instructions are right here. Call me as s—

“Oi, Apeman! I thought I showed you what we think of your kind”,

trouble made its presence known from over Larry’s shoulder.

Sitting still, raising his eyes to look past Basil at the reflection in the bar mirror. Lawrence had seen that ‘No Egrets’ tattoo before. He only new one being who hated birds enough to commit the statement to ink-on-skin. Basil could see the tension in Larry’s face.

“Don’t do anything stupid Larry. You’re on your own, I told you not to come back here.”

Dressed in black leather and denim stood a seven foot tall lump of gray skin and yellow diamond shaped bony protrusions. He pounded his fist into his palm waiting for Lawrence Tunnbottom to respond.

Lawrence reached into a pocket with one hand, tightly gripping the rabbit’s foot keychain. For luck but also to make double sure that he had the keys to make a smooth exit. His other hand moved to the inside of his coat.

“Good morning Deviator, it’s nice to see you’re in a good mood today.”

Lawrence stepped out of the booth as he heard a horse-like nasal snort from behind. He was just in time to watch the Deviator smash the table.

“Arrh, where'd you go!”

“You really would make a great salad with pickled ginger and sesame oil, but I have a lot of other errands to run today.”

The Rusty Barnacle was silent with all eyes on Lawrence Tunnbottom. A confused giant fish beast turned to see Lawrence holding up a large steel hook on a wooden tee handle.

“Now normally I’d pay my tab and leave a tip on the table. Today, I think I’ll let my friend Basil take care of that for me.”

Lawrence handed Basil a single iridium rand as he started to step slowly backward toward the backdoor. Once he passed the threshold Lawrence turned and bolted into a run.

The Deviator looked over his shoulder and called out to the bar.
“Sargent 6 Pack, Rock Bottom, Lone Twister, let’s tear this ape apart before he gets too far.”

Sargent 6 Pack finished his beer and then broke the pint glass in one hand as if it were a raw egg. Rock Bottom had hit rock bottom and was passed out on the floor beside the pool table.

“Wake up, bottom feeder. I’ll pound you into filet if you don’t get up.”

Lone Twister hit Rock Bottom with a pool cue until it broke over his back. Rock Bottom rolled over with a groan.

“But Mom I don’t wanna go school with the other fish.”

Sargent 6 Pack cracked his knuckles and then punched his way through the bar to Loner Twister and Rock Bottom.

“Come on, Cool your gills, we don’t need him. We’ve got a mouth-breather to catch.”

The snow behind the Rusty Barnacle was heavy with litter and trash overflowed from the dumpster. Lawrence had planned ahead. There was the Kestrel, parked in the snow, waiting for his escape. Lawrence slid across the hood to the driver's side. He turned to open the driver’s door. He saw the Deviator and his gang were not far behind him. Lone Twister fell face first as his feet hit the snow. He pointed out as if he could pluck Lawrence out of the air.

“He’s gettin away!”

While Larry climbed into the Kestrel the Deviator yelled,“There’s only one law on this world Larry; The big fish eat the little ones. One of these days you’ll get in water too deep to swim away!”

With the rabbit’s foot still held tightly in hand Lawrence hurried into the Kestrel. Lawrence Tunnbottom turned the key in the ignition and replied to the Deviator’s threat,“Eat snow fish brains.”

The afterburners and engine were still warm from the trip to Europa. The engine exploded to a start. The spool of the afterburners churned up a cloud of snow back toward the Rusty Barnacle which cloaked his escape and knocked the Scombraedian pursuers off their feet.
