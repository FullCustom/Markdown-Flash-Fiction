# Space 1979 | Doctor to Doktor
The flight from the asteroid transport stop to Mars had been mostly uneventful. A never ending star field and a lot of boring old stories from Melvin about people that nobody else remembered. Although small and cramped Psarah managed to fall asleep on the cold black leather rear seat. Reentry into the Martian atmosphere was never much of a problem for the Black Phoenix. But the rushing sound of the craft’s outer titanium skin heating and the occasional bump from a dust clotted cloud woke Psarah from her nap. Slowly her eyes opened. She saw a strange pink hued light through tawny dust choked clouds.

“Where are we?”

“Just entering Mars above the Tharsis Plateau. Take a look. On my side is Olympus Mons.”

Psarah sat up to look out the window. She noticed that someone had covered her up with a crocheted throw. All the colors of a North American fall were represented in the scratchiest acrylic chevrons in the known universe. There wasn’t a lot of space between the back of Melvin’s headrest and the end of the pilot’s side window. The rear stabilizer wings blocked most of the side view from the curved rear windshield. With her hand for support on the back of the pilot’s seat below the headrest Psarah found a spot to look out of the window. Melvin banked the craft to the left, slightly tipping the wing below the horizon, for a better view.

They flew lower and lower through the Martian sky. The great Olympus Mons filled more and more of the left hand view. The giant flat topped volcano sprawled out in all directions. While the light from Sol slowly fell behind the largest volcanic mountain in Solaris, the color of the sky bent red. After they flew into the shadow more details came into view. Everywhere smaller mountains dotted the Tharsis Plateau, each with its own rounded snowy glacial top.

“Melvin, you’re going to have to turn back right fifteen degrees to stay on course or we’ll miss not only our landing spot but the entire campus.”

“Alright, alright, I only wanted to give the girl a better view.”

The Black Phoenix leveled out and turned right. A few green houses came into view. Even though the Martian atmosphere was still thinner than Earth’s. Plant life had begun to spill out of the green houses. A few patches here and there. A bush, a tree, maybe a little grassy spot on the south side of a hill. After a long open stretch of dry pale sand a sprawling complex of buildings, sidewalks, and topiaries appeared.

“Just another mile until we reach Dr Weissenburg’s lab.”

“Is it that thing that looks like an overly lit warehouse turn into a shopping mall?”

“No, that’s the main office and auditorium. Weissenburg’s is the more understated brick building behind it. He said if we park on the west side that we’ll be able to walk right in.”

“Good, I’m not in the mood to sign in or talk to anyone that I don’t have to.”

“There, park right there.”

“That rusty old crate? I’m not parking next to anything with a student parking ID on it! I’ll pick my own space.”

The west end of the Heinrich Weissenburg Research Center was well landscaped with low floral hedges and brick walkways. A few scrubby juniper trees grew along the walkways. Three students sat on the stairs talking. Their breath made clouds in the cold dry Martian air.

“Hey. You, people. You know where the Doctor’s at?”

“What, Doctor?”

“Yeah, um… Half the professors here on campus are a doctor in something.

“I’m sorry for the boldness of my colleague. We are looking for Dr Weissenburg, we have a meeting with him.”

  “Evan, Gerg… if you guys want to head to Joe’s and find a table for us? I’ll show these guys to Dr Weissenburg.”

“Okay, do you want us to order anything for you?”

“Don’t you dare order one of those crab pretzels for me! I’ll order for myself when I get there. Hopefully this won’t take long.”

Psarah stared at Pam, trying to figure out why her hair was so feathery and how a girl could be built so slight without being ill.

“Hi, I’m Pam Robinson. I’ll take you to the lab and get Dr Weissenburg from his office. We can go this way.”

Pam led Melvin, Ralph, and Psarah through the west side entrance. Psarah’s sneakers squeaked on the overly waxed wide tiled floor. It was as if she was walking on escaped lab mice with every step.

Melvin grumped under his breath,

”Pick up your feet or I’ll leave you on the next asteroid that we pass.”

Pam gestured to the laboratory door as they approached it,

”You guys can wait in here while I get Dr Weissenburg. He’s waiting in the office next door.”

## ***
It didn’t take long for Pam to return with the Doctor. Even though Weissenburg wasn’t a tall man and had introspective, introverted tendencies. He could gather a room's attention like a car on fire. He spoke in a low tone with vocal fry like the last few popping kernels of popcorn.

“Willkommen, I hope you had a most uneventful trip through the asteroid belt.”

Ralph began to answer Dr Weissenburg unaware that he only engages in conversation of a rhetorical nature,

“After our last stop it w—”

“This laboratory has the highest level of security in all of Solaris. We have cameras, laser alarms, magnetic contact switches on all the doors…”

Dr Weissenburg continued to ramble. He moved to the isolation chamber. The group followed as if on an art gallery tour.

“Mercury switches in every latch. These piezoelectric floor tiles can sense the slightest vibration. Nothing can enter here unnoticed and if it did the radiation—”

Psarah pulled her jacket tighter,”does anyone else feel a draft?”
“Yeah, what’s that?”Ralph pointed to an old wooden door with a moon shaped cut-out. Old barn boards trimmed out the frame of an outhouse door that mysteriously occupied the middle of a steel wall in the isolation chamber. Sparks shot through the moon shaped cut out and the gaps in the old gray wood. Each time a new shower of sparks erupted it was followed by the sound of a man swearing and a tool thrown in anger.

Melvin turned toward Dr Weissenburg,“That some nice security there Doc, although I’d do something about that draft.”

An angry Weissenburg stomped over to the wooden door and threw it open.

“What is this and who are you!”

Inside opened up into a vast chamber larger than Dr Weissenburg’s lab. The source of the fireworks revealed itself to be a button filled console with a man underneath it wrenching away like a shade tree mechanic on an old rusty truck.

“Ow, that’s Doktor What!”

“Where is my cube! How did you breach my security!”

The Doktor looked right past the Doctor to Psarah,“You! You broke my ship!”

“You okay, it looks like you hit your head pretty hard?”

“I’ve been one step ahead of that cowboy and those gray kimchi eating weirdos for years. Now I’m stuck here.”

“I just want to get back home. Please help me”

The Doktor took a step forward picking up a large hammer. Looking at the hammer with a satisfied grin he spoke to himself,“This will do nicely.”

Psarah screams,“No! I want to go home!”

Doktor What looked up slightly startled,“I’m not your wizard, you and Grumpy the Lion can find your own road.”

As the Doktor turned around he swung the hammer down forcefully onto the top of the controls. The orange glow of burning metal and the smell of phenolic plastic filled the room. The outhouse door faded from the metal wall of the isolation chamber. The sound of an overfilled polyester jumpsuit about to give way turned to a blinding light.

With one hand on his chin in thought Dr Weissenburg muttered to himself,

”Interesting, a burst of extra-violet. It seems Doktor What is in possession of technology from outside of Solaris, very interesting.”

Ralph stated the obvious,”Well I guess that’s that. Ah, what’s all this goo.”

“Yeah, I got that stuff on my hands earlier. It’s not easy to clean off.”

Melvin looked around the scene. His suspicions were confirmed,“Oh no, not Salmonoids.”

Pam turned around to Melvin and Ralph,”What did you say?”

Ralph clarified,“Salmonoids, they’re basically fish men, they live on Europa.”

Psarah questioned,”Fishermen?”

Melvin grumbled through his mustache,”No, not fishermen. There haven’t been fishermen on Europa in a long time. These are fish grown into men. Fed on Avant Garde jazz and whatever else that happened to fall through the ice.”

“What do fish-men want with my cube?”

“They don’t want your cube. They’re the smash and grab type. They were hired by someone.”

“Wait, there were some creepy fish guys here last month. They crashed a party that I was at. I hadn’t connected the slime until now. One of them kept trying to get me to go to their van. He said he had a bed of rocks in the back. What was his name… Brian… Brice—”

Melvin interrupted,”Basil... Basil Pete.”

“Yeah, that’s it! What a creep, he was. He kept asking me if I wanted to lay my eggs. I don’t think that he understands how birds work. I had to explain to him that the brightly colored ones that he’d been talking to before me are definitely male.”

Ralph queried,”Do you have any idea where they may have headed next?”

“No, but they really smelled of lunar. I just wanted him to go away before he touched my feathers. I didn’t want to get into all the creepy reasons why it wouldn’t work out. I politely told him that birds rear their young and then walked away.”

Melvin returned to the conversation,“It sounds like Luna is our best bet for more information.”

Weissenburg interjected,”I have five rand of my own money for the safe return of the cube. This chamber was built not only for the safety of the cube but also our own reality. Please find it before it is damaged or worse.”

“Although I think the universe at large is worth a bit more than five rand, I think Ralph and I can find and return your experiment. The key will be finding out who hired Basil Pete.”

Ralph added,“Do you think this is another of Dr Sarcophagus’ schemes?”

“No he’s not into knick knacks.”

“Please take this seriously, the cube is not a mere piece of kitsch.”

“Ralph, Psarah, let’s get moving. I think I’ve heard enough. Doctor, we’ll ask around on Luna, I’m sure we’ll find something.”

Melvin walked out the door ahead of the group. Ralph reassured Weissenburg,

”It was nice to meet you Dr Weissenburg, we’ll call as soon as we find anything.”

“Please, I’m not sure that your partner understands the grave nature of this.”

As the three walked out Psarah turned to see a Cowboy standing in the corner. He gave a hat tip in approval then slowly faded into the ether.
